# Camera-Calibration-using-Linear-Method
This document shows how to do camera calibration using linear method as well as estimate the calibration performance in terms of projection error. You can try this method using 2Dpoints.txt and 3Dpoints_part.txt. The returned results include the intrinsic camera parameters: u0, v0. fu, fv, as well as the projection matrix and error assessment.
